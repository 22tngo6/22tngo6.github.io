## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 4, Part 2

	This was a fun lab because we made a game for the first time. I have been interested in the concept of making a quick game with the small codes we had learned thus far. For this lab my partner and I had to write code that uses variables, initialization, arithmetic operators, input, output, if statements, and relational operators. 

* Lab 6, Part 2

	This was my second favorite lab because we had to create a game involves scoring with a blackjack dealer. It was very interesting and challenging trying to add the ACE bonus for the first time. For this lab, we had to use std::vector<std::string> type and command line arguments to provide input to the program.

* Lab 12, Part 2 

	This was my very favorite lab because it incorporated everything we had learned throughout the semester into one final lab. It was really mind-blowing to look at the same code we had seen at the very beginning of the semester and actually be able to read and comprehend some of it. For this lab, we had to write a code that uses library functions and create a random numbers generator.
